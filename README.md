# BirdWatchingAI

This package is a tool to identify the bird species around my home. 

During the work from the office period, I have noticed many birds in and around my home. That triggered a thought to identify species and time of activity. However, my busy work schedule limited my time on this effort. 

## Objective
I have three main objectives,
- Identify the birds from the video generated by my camera. The pipeline uses an SSD (single shot detection) to identify the birds from the video.
- Group the birds (clustering) into different categories  (species) and name the categories (may need some manual effort)
- A model has to distinguish the previously named birds from the first seen birds so that the first seen birds can again go to the clustering algorithm (step 2).

## The present stage of development
the pipeline is now able to identify the bird images from video files.

## Run the code.
- clone the repo
- change the working folder
- Pipeline expects an input folder inside the working folder
- place the video file inside the input folder
- change the file name in the main.py to your video file
- run main.py will show you all the birds in the video file
