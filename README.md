# BirdWatchingAI

This package is a tool to identify the bird species around my home. 

During the work from the office period, I have noticed many birds in and around my home. That triggered a thought to identify species and time of activity. However, my busy work schedule limited my time on this effort. 

Objective
I have three main objectives,
Identify the birds from the video generated by my camera. The pipeline uses an SSD (single shot detection) to identify the birds from the video.
Group the birds (clustering) into different categories  (species) and name the categories (may need some manual effort)
A model has to distinguish the previously named birds from the first seen birds so that the first seen birds can again go to the clustering algorithm (step 2).
